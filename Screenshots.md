I cannot work out how to save the screenshots of the googlemaps.  There has been no instruction on this and google is not helpful to me on this.  Please provide instruction on this.  Some of us are complete beginners with this.  I have however, saved down screenshots in a word file in the images directory.  I know this is not the done thing, but with no other idea how to do it, it is the workaround I have choosen.
